This is the tipicaly scheme of the NOx adsorption over a support Pt-Ba catalysts.
According to the proposed scheme, in the presence of NO/O2 mixtures (the actual gases in the exhausts), NOx are stored on Ba neighboring Pt sites in the form of nitrite ad-species (route a).
Nitrite ad-species are then progressively oxidized to nitrates, which prevail at saturation (route b).
The routes (a)+(b) is called “nitrite route” and occur on the binary Pt–Ba/?-Al2O3.
Hence the presence of neighboring Pt and Ba sites is important for this route. Accordingly, Pt plays a role in both the formation of nitrites and their subsequent oxidation to nitrates.

In parallel with the “nitrite route,” oxidation of NO to NO2 on Pt sites by gaseous oxygen can also occur (route c); the NO2 thus formed is stored on BaO directly in the form of nitrates, without the intermediacy of nitrites, in according with a particular reaction called to a disproportionation reaction (route (d)).
Moreover, direct NO2 uptake in the form of nitrate cannot be excluded, although it is of minor importance.

The “nitrite” and “nitrate” pathways operate simultaneously during NO/O2 storage but the first, which is responsible for the formation of nitrites, dominates over the disproportionation route since nitrites are the most abundant species on the surface.
